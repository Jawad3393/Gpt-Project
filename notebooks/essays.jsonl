(See Appendix A) Congresspeople\u2019s stock trading has led to discussions about ethics, highlighting how important it is to tell the difference between legal and illegal investments like insider trading. Congresspeople frequently have access to material information that is not publicly known, which unfairly benefits them if they trade on that information; this also destroys public trust in Congress and the stock market. Congress must mandate blind trusts for its members to prevent conflicts of interest. This policy will protect the fairness and integrity of the stock market, prevent insider trading, and increase public trust in the legislative process.\n\nStock trading impacts financial markets, but raises ethical concerns. Addressing these issues in Congress requires understanding the difference between illegal insider trading and legal strategies like blind trusts. Stock trading comes in many forms; according to Investopedia, \u201cStock trading involves buying and selling shares in publicly traded companies.\u201d When someone wants to buy or sell a stock, they place an order through their brokerage, and the market matches buyers with sellers. Stock prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, and also company performance. There are other ways to invest, like blind trusts. Blind trusts are used to prevent conflicts of interest for people in positions of influence, like politicians or corporate executives. Blind trusts allow them to invest without knowledge or control of their investments. Insider trading, on the other hand, is illegal trading. Insider trading involves trading based on material that is nonpublic information. According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), \nAn \u201cinsider\u201d is\u2026anyone who possesses inside information because of his or her relationship with the Company or with an officer, director or principal stockholder of the Company\u2026This rule also covers any employee who has obtained material non-public corporate information, as well as any person who has received a \u201ctip\u201d from an Insider of the Company concerning information about the Company that is material and nonpublic, and trades (i.e. purchase or sells) the Company\u2019s stock or other securities. \n\nThe material has to be something that can fluctuate the price of the stock. In an interview, Aaron Husock, an Asher Capital portfolio manager, says, \u201cSo material means that it's important. It has to be something that other investors in that stock would want to know. Like, say, I was meeting with the CEO of a company. And he told me, oh, I'm thinking that tomorrow I'm going to buy all the employees pizza for lunch. That's not material\u2026\u201d Insider trading is illegal and can undermine the fairness of the stock market, but it can be prevented with blind trusts. \nInsider trading undermines market fairness and deters regular investors from participating, decreasing market liquidity and efficiency. This reduction in liquidity can negatively impact the economy by causing increased stock price spreads. When regular people who invest or trade stocks notice this unleveled playing field, they tend not to trade. According to Business Insider, not trading in the stock market leads to a \u201cdecrease in overall market liquidity and efficiency.\u201d A decrease in market liquidity is bad for the economy. When the market has high liquidity, people can quickly buy and sell stocks without big changes in the bid and ask prices. A highly liquid market encourages more participants, ensuring that trades are executed smoothly and at predictable prices. In contrast, a low liquidity market means fewer buyers and sellers are in the market, causing an increased spread of stock prices. When there is an increased spread of stock prices, companies that rely on the stock market to raise capital start losing money. This is because they face higher costs and difficulty in securing investment. Husock says, \u201cFor less liquid stocks, maybe the spread becomes a dollar and the whole capital market just starts to function poorly.\u201d Overall, a less liquid market leads to an economic slowdown. Reduced market activity interferes with capital formation and investment, further increasing economic challenges.\nMembers of Congress have access to nonpublic material information due to their roles in committees that oversee various laws and policies affecting specific stocks. This creates opportunities for insider trading. For example, if they pass a law that restricts AI use, companies that specialize in AI would see a decrease in their stocks, when Congress has this information and the ability to trade stocks they can use it illegally to avoid losses. One example of a Congressperson using nonpublic material information is New York Congressman Christopher Collins. On June 22, 2017, Collins was convicted of insider trading. In an article from the US Attorney\u2019s office, Geoffrey S. Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said \u201cFormer New York Congressman and Innate board member Christopher Collins received confidential, nonpublic information that one of Innate\u2019s drugs in development had just failed a clinical trial\u2026 Collins notified his son Cameron, so that he could trade the stock ahead of the public announcement and avoid taking a substantial loss on the stock\u2026\u201d  Congressman Collins has material information that he used to avoid losses on a stock. As a Congressperson, he should not use his job as a way to profit. Another example of Congresspeople doing suspicious activities is the former U.S. Congressman Stephen Buyer. He was convicted of insider trading. As stated by the Reuters article, \u201cProsecutors said at trial that Buyer bought Sprint stock after learning from a T-Mobile executive that the telecommunications companies were in merger talks in 2018 and made illegal trades again the following year.\u201d Buyer also acted on insider information and made profits from it. These are two of many examples of Congresspeople abusing their job as public servants for profit.\nThe STOCK Act of 2012 is currently the primary regulation preventing insider trading by Congressmembers. Implementing blind trusts and tightening enforcement of the STOCK Act will further prevent insider trading. The STOCK Act makes it mandatory for Congresspeople to report trades that are valued over $1000 within 45 days of the transaction. The consequence of violating this act is a $200 fine. In an article talking about the STOCK Act, Investopedia says, \u201cThe STOCK Act sought to address the perceived conflicts of interest in stock trading by members of Congress and other federal officials.\u201d According to many articles and Congresspeople, a blind trust would fix the issue of insider trading. Blind trusts would fix the insider trading problem because people in Congress wouldn't have a say in what they want to invest in. Another way to crack down on insider trading would be to tighten up the STOCK Act and start prosecuting cases that are in a gray area. Husock says, \u201cWe can also just prosecute some of them, right? \u2026They know that the US government has decided to give Intel $5 billion to build their new plant in Ohio and if they buy Intel stock before that announcement, they should go to jail. Like that's another way to do it is we just enforce those laws on members of Congress.\u201d Husock says that if the rules of insider trading were enforced, then a blind trust wouldn't be necessary. As of right now, there are two ways to battle insider trading, which is to expand the Stock Act and make it more strict, and the other way is to limit stock trading to blind trust for Congresspeople.  \nTo solve the problem of insider trading in Congress, blind trusts are the best solution. This policy would prevent conflicts of interest and keep the market's integrity safe. Currently, in Congress, 4 acts have been introduced to stop congressional insider trading; those 4 acts have been introduced by both Republicans and Democrats, meaning insider trading is a problem that both sides are trying to solve. One example of this is Bill S.693 introduced by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. Hawley\u2019s bill ends stock trading for executive branch officials, except for blind trusts. In this act, Hawley writes out, \nThe Department of Justice may bring a civil action in U.S. district court against any covered individual who violates this bill's prohibition. The Government Accountability Office, at specified intervals, must (1) audit compliance by a representative sample of covered individuals with this bill's requirements, and (2) report the results to the supervising ethics committees.\nThis act makes sure to keep whoever violates the prohibition accountable with civil action and also makes sure to periodically check to make sure that everyone is following the rules. Another example is from Democratic Senator Jon Ossof of Georgia, who introduced a bill to ban stock trading for Congress members. In an article by his office, it says, \u201cThe American people overwhelmingly support with 86% saying they back the measure, including 88% of Democrats, 87% of Republicans, and 81% of Independents.\u201d This quote is saying that insider trading in Congress is an issue that all sides of politics can agree on. If one of these bills passes, it will be a good step in preventing unfair trading in Congress, and building trust in the public. \n\u201cMore than 50 MPs have owned stakes in publicly listed companies that raise questions about possible conflicts of interest.\u201d This is a quote from The Guardian stating the issue of insider trading among government officials in both Congress and the UK Parliament. The action of insider trading in public offices erodes public trust and market integrity. Lawmakers are meant to serve the public, not profit illegally. Blind trusts would prevent conflicts of interest. As current members of Congress advocate for stricter trading rules and push for blind trusts it gives a hopeful path. This bipartisan support for new legislation can restore public trust. \n\nBibliography\nAmond, Ryley. \"Blind trusts can help prevent conflicts of interest \u2014 here's how to tell if they're right for you.\" CNBC.

{"prompt": "Write an essay about why George W. Bush should be charged with war crimes.\n\n", "completion": "On March 19th, 2003, former President George W. Bush invaded Iraq in fear of weapons of mass destruction. The rumor of Iraq\u2019s possession of WMDs turned out to be false. He continued the assault on Iraq for 8 years. The Bush administration killed around 280,771-315,190 innocent Iraqi civilians since the U.S invasion. According to the laws of the International Criminal Court, George W. Bush should be prosecuted for the war crimes he committed during his administration's unlawful invasion of Iraq. Bush should be charged with war crimes because his decisions were careless, he killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people, committing war crimes like targetting civilians intentionally, the war also killed American soldiers. \n\nMultiple crimes count as war crimes, according to the Rome Statute. The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutes people who have violated the Rome Statute. The ICC\u2019s definition of a war crime is, \u201cGrave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely, any of the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention.\u201d This includes willful killing, torture, unlawful damage, taking hostages, and a few other crimes that are under the Geneva Convention law. In subsection B of the war crimes article, it says, \u201cOther serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict, within the established framework of international law.\u201d For example, intentionally directing attacks on civilian populations and directing attacks on buildings like hospitals, places of religion, and education. Those are some actions that count as war crimes. \n\nLeading up to the war, Bush\u2019s decisions were based on his own opinions, not based on his legal advisors or international laws. Whenever Bush was given legal advice, he would not take it unless the advice aligned with his agenda. On September 11th, Bush was quoted as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the international lawyers say. We are going to kick some ass.\u201d Presidents are supposed to uphold and follow the laws. Here Bush has no regard for the international laws that have an impact on the US. Furthermore, Bush\u2019s legal team consisted of Alberto Gonzales and Harriet Miers who had no experience in international law, Colin Powel, who resigned because Bush did not want to adhere to Geneva Convention IV which was made to protect the civilians, and a few other advisors like John Ashcroft and James Comey who quit because their opinions were not listened to. George W. Bush was a president who needed legal advice but did not take any of the advice to heart.\n\t\nThe rumor of Iraq\u2019s possession of WMDs led to an unnecessary war that lasted for 8 years and killed countless people. The rumor of WMDs turned out to be false. Although the data may not be correct, Bush\u2019s administration killed 315,190 civilians from 2003 to 2023. The number continues to grow because of the damage done by the US to Iraq\u2019s infrastructure. Some of those infrastructures include health care, food, water, and housing. In an article written by The Guardian, readers see the brutal effects of the invasion of Iraq. One story is about Showkat Abdullah al-Mashhdani, he studied and received a Ph.D. in America, and he also was a husband and father to 7 children. He was an innocent person who was trying to save children and was shot and killed in cold blood by the US Army. Wakkara the wife of Abdullah shared,\n\n\u201cWe blame the US army for destroying our life. He was my best friend as well as my husband and I feel that life stopped completely after his death. I am just waiting to join him. My health suffered a lot and now I have to take all kinds of medication for high blood pressure and diabetes, caused by the shock.\u201d \n\nThe US military physically killed someone while also figuratively killing the rest of the family.\n\nAfter one year of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest, but 12 years after the invasion of Iraq nothing has been done. The ICC issued a war crime for Putin. They did this because Putin did not have control over his military that was in Ukraine. His military was not held accountable for the crimes they committed. The ICC watched Iraqi civilians being tortured and killed and did nothing about it, they stood there and watched like bystanders. When it came to Ukraine, the ICC sprung to action right away and was able to charge Putin within a year. There is a bias within the ICC, when Muslims and people of color are being killed brutally, the ICC does not bat an eye. However, when white people are being killed something has to be done right away.\n\nBush\u2019s administration committed 269 war crimes, and most of those crimes were directly committed by Bush himself. One of those crimes was the excessive targeting of civilians. The U.S. military targeted multiple civilian populated areas, which led to massive casualties in the death of innocent bystanders like children. Pillaging was another war crime that was committed, the US military took: In the War Crimes book, Haas wrote, \u201ccash, printing presses, weapons, and other objects from some buildings\u2026During the high point of the insurgency in Iraq, soldiers who searched houses sometimes took cash that they saw lying around.\u201d Not only did they kill people and destroy lives but they also stole expensive items from the civilians. \n\n\tNot only did the invasion of Iraq affect the innocent people of Iraq, but it also affected America on a certain level. About 5,000 US soldiers died during the Iraq war. That\u2019s a huge loss to America\u2019s military and to the families of those who lost their lives. The US spent around $3 trillion for the invasion of Iraq and other costs relating to the invasion. In an article written by the Guardian, they say that one of those trillions of dollars could have paid for: \u201c8 million housing units, or 15 million public school teachers, or healthcare for 530 million children for a year, or scholarships to university for 43 million students. Three trillion could have fixed America's social security problem for half a century.\u201d If America had not invested so much money in an illegal war, different aspects of America's economy could have been improved. \n\nThe unlawful and brutal invasion of Iraq caused an extreme loss of life for both Iraqis and Americans. Former President George W. Bush should be charged for all 269 war crimes he committed during the invasion. Bush\u2019s decisions leading up to the war were not legally advised by qualified lawyers and were made with mostly his input. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq was unjustified and brutal; killing more than 315,190 civilians. The ICC almost instantly issued a warrant for Putin, but Bush was never considered a war criminal. Bush committed 269 war crimes, but he was never prosecuted for any of them. The invasion of Iraq left a negative impact on America\u2019s economy and killed around 5,000 US soldiers. 12 years after the invasion of Iraq, the perpetrator is still out in the world free, even though the whole world knows he\u2019s guilty.  \n\nBibliography\nEdemariam, Aida. \"The true cost of war.\" The Guardian, February 28, 2008.
